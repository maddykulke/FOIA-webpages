# FOIA-webpages

We are two [Coding it Forward Civic Digital Fellows](https://codingitforward.com/) supporting the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/), helping the agency leverage technology in its mission to [put patients first](https://www.cms.gov/About-CMS/story-page/patients-over-paperwork.html). 

This repository includes prototypes of a web-based Medicare information release authorization form and proposed updates to [related webpages](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/FOIA/) supporting Medicare FOIA requests currently hosted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Revisions to the form are based on user interviews both with end users, and with the CMS employees who process them. Our goal is to allow for faster, more intuitive completion and processing of Medicare FOIA requests submitted directly to CMS.

Feedback, thoughts, and suggestions, are always welcome!

The homepage for our web prototype of Medicare FOIA Authorization flow can be found [here](https://maddykulke.github.io/FOIA-webpages/). <br/>
