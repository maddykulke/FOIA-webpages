# FOIA-webpages

We are two [Coding it Forward Civic Digital Fellows](https://codingitforward.com/) supporting the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services via a 10-week fellowship, helping the agency leverage technology in its missions to [put patients first](https://www.cms.gov/). 

This repository includes prototypes of a web-based Medicare information release authorization form and proposed updates to related webpages supporting Medicare FOIA requests currently hosted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 

Feedback, thoughts, and suggestions, are always welcome!
