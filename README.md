# FOIA-webpages

We are two [Coding it Forward Civic Digital Fellows](https://codingitforward.com/) supporting the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/), helping the agency leverage technology in its missions to [put patients first](https://www.cms.gov/About-CMS/story-page/patients-over-paperwork.html). 

This repository includes prototypes of a web-based Medicare information release authorization form and proposed updates to [related webpages](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/FOIA/) supporting Medicare FOIA requests currently hosted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 

Feedback, thoughts, and suggestions, are always welcome!
